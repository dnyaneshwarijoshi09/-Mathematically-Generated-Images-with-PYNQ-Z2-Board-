# -Mathematically-Generated-Images-with-PYNQ-Z2-Board-
This project demonstrates the generation of mathematically inspired images, such as recursive fractal trees and Koch snowflakes, using Python on the PYNQ-Z2 board. Mathematical algorithms are implemented to produce intricate, colorful patterns in real time.
