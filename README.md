# -Mathematically-Generated-Images-with-PYNQ-Z2-Board-
This project demonstrates the generation of mathematically inspired images, such as recursive fractal trees and Koch snowflakes, using Python on the PYNQ-Z2 board. Mathematical algorithms are implemented to produce intricate, colorful patterns in real time.

Two main graphics modules are showcased:

Recursive Fractal Tree Generator:

Uses trigonometric functions and recursion to simulate natural branching structures.
Adjustable parameters such as recursion depth and branch spread allow interactive control over tree complexity.
HSV-based coloring ensures a smooth gradient along branches, creating visually appealing results.

Koch Snowflake Generator:

Implements the classic fractal curve algorithm where each line segment is recursively divided into smaller segments with angular offsets.
Produces symmetric snowflake-like patterns with increasing detail at higher recursion levels.
The PYNQ-Z2 board runs Python scripts to render images, which can be displayed in Jupyter Notebooks or exported as image files for further use.

Applications:

Educational demonstrations of recursion, fractal geometry, and algorithmic art.
Interactive mathematics visualization in embedded systems.
Creative digital art generation using low-cost hardware platforms.

Key Features:

Interactive parameter tuning with ipywidgets.
Real-time rendering of complex mathematical shapes.
Fully implemented in Python for portability to other platforms.
